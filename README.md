# Complete-Process-Models

This repository contains the complete process models for the research paper by Priya Naguine titled "Process Comparison and Bottleneck Analysis for Subpopulations of Patients Diagnosed with Frozen Shoulder"

The repository contains the following process models:
1. [age_above_60_IVM.png][1]: This contains the process model for the care paths of frozen shoulder patients aged above 60. This process model was created using the **Mine with Inductive visual Miner** plugin in ProM.
2. [age_below_40_IVM.png][2]: This contains the process model for the care paths of frozen shoulder patients aged below 40. This process model was created using the **Mine with Inductive visual Miner** plugin in ProM.
3. [age_between_40_and_60_IVM.png][3]: This contains the process model for the care paths of frozen shoulder patients aged between 40 and 60. This process model was created using the **Mine with Inductive visual Miner** plugin in ProM.
4. [bottlenecks_medications.png][4]: This contains the process model for the medications taken (i.e., continuous infusions and intermittent administrations) by frozen shoulder patients. This process model was created using the **Performance** function in Disco, with *median duration* as the first metric and *absolute frequency* as the second metric.
5. [bottlenecks_procedures.png][5]: This contains the process model for the general procedures followed by frozen shoulder patients. This process model was created using the **Performance** function in Disco, with *median duration* as the first metric and *absolute frequency* as the second metric.
6. [female_IVM.png][6]: This contains the process model for the care paths of female frozen shoulder patients. This process model was created using the **Mine with Inductive visual Miner** plugin in ProM.
7. [male_IVM.png][7]: This contains the process model for the care paths of male frozen shoulder patients. This process model was created using the **Mine with Inductive visual Miner** plugin in ProM.
